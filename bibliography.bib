	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as
	            crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However,
	            the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by
	            complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as
	            ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between
	            accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have
	            recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of
	            complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are
	            related and when one method is preferable over another. To address
	            this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting
	            predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns
	            each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its
	            novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of
	            additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results
	            showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of
	            desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods,
	            notable because several recent methods in the class lack the
	            proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this
	            unification, we present new methods that show improved
	            computational performance and/or better consistency with human
	            intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary
	            artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable
	            machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative
	            decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails
	            assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining
	            even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet
	            simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces
	            ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective
	            grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding
	            overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent
	            biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in
	            collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In
	            this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence
	            for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of
	            efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and
	            achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are
	            threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic
	            completions of games with missing coalition values along with the
	            arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that
	            facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to
	            minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by
	            disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and
	            online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the
	            algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an
	            investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.

	            We theoretically show the properties of Q-learning with SMR, e.g.,

	            usually employs values of all coalitions. However, in some
	            applications, the values of some of the coalitions might be unknown
	            due to high costs associated with their determination or simply
	            because it is not possible to determine them exactly. We introduce
	            a method to approximate standard solution concepts based only on
	            partial characteristic function of the cooperative game. In this
	            paper, we build on our previous results and generalise the results
	            of our methods to a significantly larger class of structures of

	abstract = { Many auctions involve the sale of a variety of distinct assets.
	            Examples are airport time slots, delivery routes, network routing,

	            between the different assets, bidders have preferences not just for

	            efficiency is enhanced if bidders are allowed to bid on bundles or
	            combinations of different assets. This paper surveys the state of

	            functions occur in many mathematical models in economy, engineering

	            N (|N| = n) be some ground set and v:2N→ R be a function. We say
	            that v˜:2N→ R is an α-sketch of v if for every set S we have that
	            v(S)/α ≤ v˜(S) ≤ v(S) and v˜ can be described in poly(n)
	            bits.Goemans et al. [SODA’09] showed that if v is submodular then
	            there exists an \~{o}(√n)-sketch that can be constructed using
	            polynomially many value queries (this is essentially the best
	            possible, as Balcan and Harvey [STOC’11] show that no submodular
	            function admits an n1/3 - ϵ-sketch). Based on their work, Balcan et
	            al. [COLT’12] and Badanidiyuru et al. [SODA’12] show that if v is
	            subadditive, then there exists an \~{o}(√n)-sketch that can be
	            constructed using polynomially many demand queries. All previous
	            sketches are based on complicated geometric constructions. The
	            first step in their constructions is proving the existence of a
	            good sketch by finding an ellipsoid that “approximates” v well
	            (this is done by applying John’s theorem to ensure the existence of
	            an ellipsoid that is “close” to the polymatroid that is associated
	            with v). The second step is to show that this ellipsoid can be
	            found efficiently, and this is done by repeatedly solving a certain
	            convex program to obtain better approximations of John’s
	            ellipsoid.In this article, we give a significantly simpler,
	            nongeometric proof for the existence of good sketches and utilize
	            the proof to obtain much faster algorithms that match the
	            previously obtained approximation bounds. Specifically, we provide
	            an algorithm that finds \~{o}(√n)-sketch of a submodular function
	            with only \~{o}(n3/2 value queries, and we provide an algorithm
	            that finds \~{o}(√n)-sketch of a subadditive function with O(n)
	            demand and value queries.},

	            optimization. Algorithms that involve submodular functions usually
	            assume that they are given by a (value) oracle. Many interesting
	            problems involving submodular functions can be solved using only
	            polynomially many queries to the oracle, e.g., exact minimization
	            or approximate maximization.In this paper, we consider the problem
	            of approximating a non-negative, monotone, submodular function f on
	            a ground set of size n everywhere, after only poly(n) oracle
	            queries. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm that makes
	            poly(n) oracle queries and derives a function f such that, for

	            α(n) = √n+1 for rank functions of matroids and α(n), = O(√n log n)
	            for general monotone submodular functions. Our result is based on
	            approximately finding a maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid in a

	            properties of submodular functions and polymatroids.Our algorithm
	            is tight up to logarithmic factors. Indeed, we show that no
