\chapter{Revealed Subsets}
\label{app:subsets}

In the main text, we present figures outlining for a given budget, what percentage of budgets of a given size were selected by each algorithm for a given budget.
Here, for completeness, we offer more detailed figures, showing what subsets were actually selected.
