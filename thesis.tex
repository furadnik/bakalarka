	First, I would like to thank my supervisor, David Sychrovský, for his support throughout writing this thesis, for always finding time to chat with me, and for not losing his mind when I was being stubborn.
	I also thank my consultant, Martin Černý, especially for checking the formal proofs, and for providing insights regarding cooperative game theory.
	I would further like to thank both of them for introducing me to this topic, and getting me excited about this project.

	I would also like to thank Martin Loebl, Jakub Černý, and everyone else who has reviewed the draft of this thesis for providing valuable feedback.
	Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support throughout my studies.
